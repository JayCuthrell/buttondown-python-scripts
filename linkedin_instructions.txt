How to Repackage Content (e.g. sharing links or off-platform resources onto Linkedln)

* Include 2-4 insights or takeaways from the content you're sharing
*What are 2-4 things the audience will learn if they read onward?
* Or, what's your perspective?
* Make the value clear in the first two opening lines
* Open your post with your most interesting, eye-catching or differentiated points.
* In other words, share something new or surprising in your opening lines.
* Don't hold back, Linkedin audiences like openings that convey what value they're going to get if they click "see more"
* Offer enough substance, perspective, and value without forcing a click.
* Linkedin audiences like something meaty to get their teeth stuck into.
